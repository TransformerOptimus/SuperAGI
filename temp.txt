Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.\nPlay to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\nIf you have completed all your tasks or reached end state, make sure to use the "finish" tool.\n\nGOALS:\n1. think and write poem on night also add rhyming\n\n\n\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n2. Ensure the tool and args are as per current plan and reasoning\n3. Exclusively use the tools listed under "TOOLS"\n4. REMEMBER to format your response as JSON, using double quotes ("") around keys and string values, and commas (,) to separate items in arrays and objects. IMPORTANTLY, to use a JSON object as a string in another JSON object, you need to escape the double quotes.\n\n\nTOOLS:\n1.

User Interface:\nThe user interface should be a simple command-line interface where the user is prompted to enter the number of lines, the type of poem, and the mood of the poem. The generated poem is then printed to the console.\n\n5. Testing:\nUnit tests should be written to ensure that each of the poem generation methods is working as expected.

Program Description:\nThe program is designed to generate a poem about the sun. It should be able to take user inputs for the number of lines, the type of poem (rhyming, free verse, haiku, etc.), and the mood of the poem (happy, melancholic, etc.). The program should generate a unique poem based on these inputs.\n\n2. Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:\n\nClass: PoemGenerator\nThis is the main class that will be responsible for generating the poem.\n\nMethods within PoemGenerator:\n\n- def __init__(self, lines, type, mood): \n  This is the constructor method that initializes the poem generator with the number of lines, the type of poem, and the mood of the poem.\n\n- def generate_poem(self): \n  This method generates the poem based on the provided inputs. It calls the appropriate poem type method and passes the number of lines and mood to it.\n\n- def generate_rhyming_poem(self, lines, mood): \n  This method generates a rhyming poem about the sun based on the number of lines and the mood.\n\n- def generate_free_verse_poem(self, lines, mood): \n  This method generates a free verse poem about the sun based on the number of lines and the mood.\n\n- def generate_haiku_poem(self, mood): \n  This method generates a haiku poem about the sun based on the mood. The number of lines for a haiku is always three, so it does not need the lines parameter.\n\n3. Non-standard Dependencies:\n\n- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): This library will be used for language processing tasks, such as generating rhyming words for the rhyming poem method.\n\n- TextBlob: This library will be used for part-of-speech tagging, which will be helpful in generating grammatically correct sentences.\n\n4. User Interface:\nThe user interface should be a simple command-line interface where the user is prompted to enter the number of lines, the type of poem, and the mood of the poem. The generated poem is then printed to the console.\n\n5. Testing:\nUnit tests should be written to ensure that each of the poem generation methods is working as expected. For example, a test could check that the generate_haiku_poem method always returns a poem with three lines.\nSpecification generated and saved successfully', 'You are SuperAGI an AI assistant to solve complex problems.

superagi-celery-1  | In its care, life begins to bloom.
superagi-celery-1  | A silent whisper, a gentle touch,
superagi-celery-1  | In its absence, the world craves much.
superagi-celery-1  | 
superagi-celery-1  | 
superagi-celery-1  | It roars in the storm, it weeps in the rain,
superagi-celery-1  | In its cycle, joy and pain.
superagi-celery-1  | A force untamed, a spirit free,
superagi-celery-1  | In its flow, the world's decree.
superagi-celery-1  | 
superagi-celery-1  | 
superagi-celery-1  | So, let's honor the water, the life's song,
superagi-celery-1  | In its melody, we all belong.
superagi-celery-1  | For without it, the world would falter,
superagi-celery-1  | In its essence, we find the altar.
