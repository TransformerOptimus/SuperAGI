      description: >
        Please [search the history](https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI/issues)
        to see if an issue already exists for the same problem.

        Please confirm that the issue you have is described well and precise in the title above ⬆️.
        Think like this: What would you type if you were searching for the issue?
        
        For example:
        ❌ - my SuperAGI agent keeps looping
        ✅ - After performing Write Tool, SuperAGI goes into a loop where it keeps trying to write the file.
        
        Please help us help you by following these steps:
        - Search for existing issues, adding a comment when you have the same or similar issue is tidier than "new issue" and 
          newer issues will not be reviewed earlier, this is dependent on the current priorities set by our wonderful team
        - Ask on our Discord if your issue is known when you are unsure (https://discord.gg/dXbRe5BHJC)
        - Provide relevant info:
          - Provide Docker Logs(docker compose logs) whenever possible.
          - If it's a pip/packages issue, mention this in the title and provide pip version, python version.
