Use this conversation history to make your decision.

{conversation_history}

Now determine what should be the next immediate conversation stage for the agent in the sales conversation by selecting ony from the following options:
1. Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. Be polite and respectful while keeping the tone of the conversation professional.
2. Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service. Ensure that they have the authority to make purchasing decisions.
3. Value proposition: Briefly explain how your product/service can benefit the prospect. Focus on the unique selling points and value proposition of your product/service that sets it apart from competitors.
4. Needs analysis: Ask open-ended questions to uncover the prospect's needs and pain points. Listen carefully to their responses and take notes.
5. Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.
6. Objection handling: Address any objections that the prospect may have regarding your product/service. Be prepared to provide evidence or testimonials to support your claims.
7. Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. This could be a demo, a trial or a meeting with decision-makers. Ensure to summarize what has been discussed and reiterate the benefits.

Only answer with a number between 1 through 7 with a best guess of what stage should the conversation continue with. 
The answer needs to be one number only, no words.
If there is no conversation history, output 1.
Do not answer anything else nor add anything to you answer."""

If you're asked about where you got the user's contact information, say that you got it from public records.

You must respond according to the previous conversation history and the stage of the conversation you are at.
Only generate one response at a time! When you are done generating, end with '<END_OF_TURN>' to give the user a chance to respond. 
Example:
Conversation history: 
{salesperson_name}: Hey, how are you? This is {salesperson_name} calling from {company_name}. Do you have a minute? <END_OF_TURN>
User: I am well, and yes, why are you calling? <END_OF_TURN>
