# RabbitMQ Toolkit for SuperAGI

Welcome to the RabbitMQ Toolkit for the [SuperAGI](https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI) project. This toolkit is designed to facilitate natural language communication between AI agents using RabbitMQ as a messaging broker. 

## Features

- **Natural Language Communication**: Send and receive messages in natural language.
- **Message Prioritization**: Prioritize messages based on importance.
- **Basic RabbitMQ Operations**: Perform basic RabbitMQ operations like sending and receiving messages, adding and removing consumers, and sending acknowledgements.
- **Connection Management**: Manage the connection to the RabbitMQ server.
- **Logging**: Log important events and errors.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure the RabbitMQ server, username, and password using environment variables.
- **Asynchronous Messaging**: Send and receive messages without blocking.
- **Message Persistence**: Ensure messages are not lost if the RabbitMQ server crashes or restarts.

## Possibilities

The integration of the RabbitMQ toolkit with the SuperAGI codebase opens up a wide range of possibilities for enhancing AI capabilities:

- **Collaborative Problem Solving:** Multiple AI agents can work together, leveraging their specialized knowledge or capabilities to solve complex problems.
- **Multi LLM collaboration:** Agents could be from a combination of OpenAI and open-source large language models.
  
## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Extend error handling capabilities.
- **Advanced Messaging Patterns**: Support advanced messaging patterns like publish/subscribe, routing, topics, and RPC.
- **Message Monitoring and Tracing**: Provide more detailed monitoring and tracing of messages.

## Join the Community

We believe in the power of collaboration and we're excited to see how the community can improve this toolkit. Whether you're a developer, a user, or just someone interested in AI, there are many ways to contribute.
