When there has been loss of unrighteousness, then Lord Vishnu has saved this earth from the unrighteous by taking an avatar in every age. Through this song, I have described every incarnation of Lord Vishnu in a concise manner. This is a small and beautiful effort to show the ten avatars which will hopefully touch your hearts.\n\nDASHAVATAR\nThe Dashavatar refers to the ten primary incarnations (avatars) of Vishnu, the Hindu God of preservation which has Rigvedic origins. Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore cosmic order. The word Dashavatara derives from da\u015ba, meaning 'ten', and avatar (avat\u0101ra), roughly equivalent to 'incarnation'. The most popular ten avatars based on many puranas are Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, and Kalki.\n\nINSTAGRAM\nNarci: narci_thoughts\nEzik: being_ezik\nBhuvan Sharma: sharma_bhuvan\nAasheesh Kashyap: aasheesh.k\nSachin Kotal: sachin_kotal\nNitin Kumar: kathakarnitin\nYogesh aka Vampire: yogesh_the.bowcrew\nAaryan Kashyap: aaryankashyapp\nRohit Singh: rohit_7621\nSuryavanshi Rangmanch: suryavanshi_rangmanch\n\n#Dashavatar #Narci #BhuvanSharma #Ezik", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cf956pNUnFw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cf956pNUnFw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cf956pNUnFw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cf956pNUnFw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cf956pNUnFw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "NARCI", "tags": ["Narci", "dashavatar", "dashavatar Narci", "Narci Dashavatar", "Narci Dasavatar song", "dashavatar Narci song", "Narci Dashavatar songs", "Narci Dashavatar Hinduism", "Narci Dashavatar Hindu", "Narci Dashavatar Vishnu Purana", "narci dasavatharam"], "categoryId": "10", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Dashavatar | Narci | Bhuvan Sharma (Prod.
