"""
This module provides functionalities to handle and send learning data to RudderStack
for the purpose of analysis and to improve the gpt-engineer system. The data is sent
only when the user gives consent to share.

The module provides the following main functions:

- `send_learning`: Directly send a learning data to RudderStack.
- `collect_learnings`: Extract, possibly adjust, and send the learning data based on
  provided input parameters.
- `steps_file_hash`: Computes the SHA-256 hash of the steps file, which might be used
  for identifying the exact version or changes in the steps.

Dependencies:
- hashlib: For generating SHA-256 hash.
- typing: For type annotations.
- gpt_engineer.core: Core functionalities of gpt-engineer.
- gpt_engineer.cli.learning: Handles the extraction of learning data.

Note:
    Data sent to RudderStack is not shared with third parties and is used solely to
    improve gpt-engineer and allow it to handle a broader range of use cases.
    Consent logic is in gpt_engineer/learning.py.
