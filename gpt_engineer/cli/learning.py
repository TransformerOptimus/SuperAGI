"""
This module provides tools and data structures for supporting a feedback loop in the GPT Engineer application.

The primary intent of this module is to gather feedback from the user on the output of the gpt-engineer tool,
with their consent, and to store this feedback for further analysis and improvement of the tool.

Classes:
----------
Review:
    Represents user's review of the generated code.
Learning:
    Represents the metadata and feedback collected for a session in which gpt-engineer was used.

Functions:
----------
human_review_input() -> Review:
    Interactively gathers feedback from the user regarding the performance of generated code.

check_consent() -> bool:
    Checks if the user has previously given consent to store their data and if not, asks for it.

collect_consent() -> bool:
    Verifies if the user has given consent to store their data or prompts for it.

ask_if_can_store() -> bool:
    Asks the user if it's permissible to store their data for gpt-engineer improvement.

logs_to_string(steps: List[Step], logs: DB) -> str:
    Converts logs of steps into a readable string format.

extract_learning(model: str, temperature: float, steps: List[Step], dbs: DBs, steps_file_hash) -> Learning:
    Extracts feedback and session details to create a Learning instance.

get_session() -> str:
    Retrieves a unique identifier for the current user session.

Constants:
----------
TERM_CHOICES:
    Terminal color choices for user interactive prompts.
